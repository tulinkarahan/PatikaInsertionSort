When applied to a conserved quantity, it becomes remarkably simple and effective. However, it can also be extended to encompass any extensive quantity. Given the conservation of mass, energy, momentum, electric charge, and other natural quantities under specific conditions, continuity equations can be used to describe a wide range of physical phenomena.\n",
